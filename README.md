# Life-of-Sam

For our first project, we made a simple text adventure game using the Unity UI. My game presents a narrative to the player, offering players options and then adjusting the narrative as they progress based on their decisions, with multiple possible endings. This game does not require much coding: beyond a basic script or two to manage your game objects, most of your work can be focused simply on creating the UI elements you need and setting them up properly in the editor. 


Part A Reequirements)

Must have a branching narrative structure where players can select from more than one option and see different text based on their decisions

Must include at least ten different narrative nodes (i.e., narrative outcomes)

Must use Text objects to give each narrative node a title, a description, and button labels appropriate to the choices available to players for that node

Must use Button objects to handle behavior for the player selecting a choice, so that when they click a button, it brings them to a new narrative node

Must clearly indicate to the player when they have reached an ending (e.g. with text or a special button) and offer a way for them to loop back to the first narrative node to play again 

Part B Requirements)

Must include at least one looping background music track that plays on start

Must include at least one sound effect that plays when a button is clicked

Must scale the UI appropriately for the following screen resolutions: (PC: 1366x768 | 1920x1080, Phone: 750x1334 | 1080x1920 Tablet: 768x1024)

Must use at least one font other than Arial

Muse use at least one attribute to organize the Editor (e.g. [Header])

Muse provide a summary comment to describe at least one script

Must include at least one other comment explaining how something works
